*Py3plex* - documentation
#########################

Welcome to the *py3plex* library's documentation! Here, user can learn more about how *py3plex* can be used to solve problems related to complex networks!

The aim of this library is to:

#. Provide primitives for working with multilayer (and multiplex) complex networks
#. Provide a core set of algorithm for statistical analysis of such networks
#. Provide extensive collection of network decomposition algorithms
#. Provide python wrappers for highly efficient algorithm implementations


.. code:: bash

    pip install py3plex
